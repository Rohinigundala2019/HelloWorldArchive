# Shell Script

- Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks on Unix-like operating systems (e.g., Linux, macOS) or Windows via WSL or Git Bash.
- Scripts are written in plain text files and contain a series of commands that are executed sequentially by the shell interpreter.
- Common uses include file manipulation, system administration, and task automation, making it an essential skill for developers and system administrators.

## Getting Started:

### 1. Install:
