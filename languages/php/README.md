# PHP

- PHP is a popular server-side scripting language used for web development.
- It is embedded in HTML and can interact with databases, manage sessions, and handle forms.
- PHP powers dynamic websites and applications, making it a cornerstone of modern web development.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install:

- Choose the Thread Safe version if you plan to use PHP with a web server like Apache. Choose Non-Thread Safe if you plan to use PHP with IIS.
- Extract the downloaded .zip file to a directory, ex: C:\Php.
- Add the PHP to the System path in the Environment Variables.
- Verify Installation:
```bash
php -v

### 2. Execution:

```
- If you don't have a web server, you can run the script via the command line:
```bash
php HelloWorld.php
```
- Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
